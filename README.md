# USB_HUB_Power_Controlled
This project aim to create a USB HUB, which can help you control an USB port via a command sent from user.

HID interface: no need to install any driver to make it works.
Python control: you can use HID lib to control the board.
Simple HID program: Attached a simple HID program to help you test connection.

## ðŸš€ Features
 - **[How to write data to an ENDPOINT](https://github.com/AnhGeek/USB_Relay_HID/tree/main#-how-to-use)**: instruction how to write a new value to an ENDPOINT. You can control USB port with a data written to ENDPOINT0

## ðŸ’» MCU Used
- CH551G: datasheet [Eng ver](https://akizukidenshi.com/goodsaffix/CH552.pdf)
- Programmer: CH551G doesn't need a programmer hardware, you can download program via USB interface. It only needs a [Download Tool](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/WCHISPTool_Setup_exe.html) to flash the software.
